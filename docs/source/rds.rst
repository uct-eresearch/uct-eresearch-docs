Getting Access to the RDS
------------

1. You will need to have an active UCT staff or student account at UCT.  Third Party accounts are no longer permitted on the cluster.

2. Before applying please read the UCT eResearch HPC Acceptable Use Policy.

3. We require an acknowledgement in any thesis, paper, publication or presentation that references results computed on our infrastructure. In addition, we would like to be able to reference these published works.

4. Before your account can be created your supervisor must approve the request. When selecting your PI from the dropdown list you must select the correct PI account. Your PI will receive an automated email asking for their approval along with steps on how to approve the request. They must reply to this request from their UCT email account. We recommend contacting your PI once you have applied for access to ensure that they have received the approval email.   Once they have responded to the approval email from their UCT email address the system will automatically forward your request to the HPC team who will then create your account.

Please note:
- If you select your PI's old student account then the application will fail
- If there is an auto-forward on your PI's email to another account the approval will fail.
- If your PI does not respond to the request within 2 weeks the application will fail.

5. To apply for an account you will need to login to the UCT ServiceNow portal. If you receive the message “You are either not authorized or record is not valid.” then please login to the ServiceNow portal by selecting the Login link, top right, and login with your UCT credentials.
